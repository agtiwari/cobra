There are currently 3 languages that have an sdk to communicate with a cobra server.

* Python (the cobras modules itself).
* C++. The cobra sdk code is part of IXWebSocket, under the [ixcobra](https://github.com/machinezone/IXWebSocket/tree/master/ixcobra/ixcobra) folder.
* Javascript. The code can be found in the cobra python repository, [here](https://github.com/machinezone/cobra/tree/master/sdk/javascript). We will try to publish it to npm, and maybe make it its own repo.
